## 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

**Example**:  
Message: `HELLO`  
Shift: `3`  
Encrypted: `KHOOR`

## 📁 Files Included

- `encryption_ceaser.py`: Main Python script for the GUI-based Caesar Cipher tool.
- `output.mp4`: A video demonstration of the project in action.
- `preview.png`: Screenshot of the application interface.

## 🖥️ Features

- ✅ GUI built with **Tkinter**
- ✅ Supports both **encryption** and **decryption**
- ✅ Preserves **uppercase/lowercase** letters
- ✅ Ignores non-alphabetic characters (punctuation, numbers)
- ✅ Clean layout with emojis and color styling
- ✅ Includes a **Clear** button to reset fields

## 🧠 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

- **Encrypt Mode**: Shifts letters forward by the specified amount.
- **Decrypt Mode**: Shifts letters backward using the same key.
- Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
